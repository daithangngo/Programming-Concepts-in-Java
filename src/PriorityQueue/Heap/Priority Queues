arbitrary insertion of elements
sorted removal of elements

Selection-sort:
best case: O(n)
worst case: O(n^2)-> O(n + (n-1) + ... + 2 + 1 )

Heap-sort:
insertion and removal in logarithmic time


Heaps:
-binary trees
-build: n-times shiftDown(): each elements from deepest height upwards
-all nodes are either [greater than or equal to](max heaps) or [less than or equal to](min heaps)
each of its children
