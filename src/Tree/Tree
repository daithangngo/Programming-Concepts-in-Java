- Trees
    - Operations:
        - find
        - remove
        - insert
        - findAll
    - Binary Search Tree
        - keys of the left children are smaller or equal
        - realization of a map
        - find
            - returns value or null if not found
            - worst case a linked listâ†’ O(n)
        - insert
            - follow the path starting from the root to find the position where the respective node's place is
        - remove(k)
            - find(k)
            - remove node if no children
            - node with children case 1: only one external node
                - replace the node with the external node
            - node with children case 2: 2 internal nodes
                - look for the leftmost node and put its value to the intent to delete node
                - then call the method in case 1 on the leftmost node
